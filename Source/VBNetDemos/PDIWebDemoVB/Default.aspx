	<p>The <strong>EWSoftware Personal Data Interchange (PDI) Library</strong> presents you with a complete set of
classes that let you have access to all objects, properties, parameter types, and data types as defined by the
vCard (RFC 2426), vCalendar, and iCalendar (RFC 2445) specifications.  Using these classes, you can read and
write data files in a well-defined format used by many applications on various platforms to exchange personal
information such as business cards, telephone numbers, addresses, dates and times of appointments, etc.</p>

	<p>A recurrence engine is also provided that allows you to easily and reliably calculate recurrence dates
and times for even the most complex recurrence patterns.  The classes can be used in both Windows Forms
applications and ASP.NET web applications.</p>
